**Introduction**

Every individual is unique in one way or the other. I believe every individual has heard this at least once.  So, how is this related to this topic. Guessing by the topic, most of you would have thought I am going to discuss about some serious mental disorders like *bipolar disorder, dementia, schizophrenia or autism*. 
Most of us think we are perfect in that aspect and we straight. But you are not, we are not. Please forgive me if this seems harsh on you, but someway or the other you need to know the truth. We call it **UNDETECTED COMMON MENTAL DISORDERS**. Don’t get all worked up reading just these lines. 
I am here to discuss some of the small things we have kept ignoring for years and help you identify them. To solve a problem, the only way is to figure out what it is first, because finding a solution to a problem is only a small part. 
If you are having any of these below don’t get angry or upset, these are not diseases but conditions which can be turned over. We could never fully recover from some of these, because it is a part of us. But sure, we can try to keep it under control. And I promise you there are a million ways to do that, not just by spending big numbers on psychiatrists.
